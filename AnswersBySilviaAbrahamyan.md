# 					Internship  Answers
1. I am interested in development team at this moment because I have knowledge and experience in that sphere but after internship I would like to attend QA team.
2. My favorite language is Java because its same time very hard and modern language. Java is improved version of C++ and I can use Java with very widely and deeply frameworks like Spring, Hibernate/JPA,  Maven and don't forgetting Android platform where are used the Java programming language. Well Java is very used language.
3. Linked List is dynamic structure of data, consist of node where every nodes has reference of the next and the previous node.
4. If the large group of people kept their sequences then I will serve them like FIFO(First In, First Out) method.

5. - I should check what kind of pen is it.
 - I should check size, weight and breadth.
 - I should check if the pen's ink gets leaked.
 - I should check if pen is straight.
 - I should check what kind of person would use pen.


6. Make sure that the product has the correct specifications that will allow you to track and program the device
 

7. I will sum numbers from one to one million and assign value to x variable then will sum numbers with missing number and assign value to y. After I subtract (x - y) and will find the missing number.

8. 1 minutes is 6 degree because 360 degree divided by 60 minutes ( 1 hour) is 6 then I will multiply 6 with the length between two sticks. 
6 * 5 = 30 degree


9. I will use bitwise And operator between the number who is a power of two in binary version and the same with subtract 1 because the number who is a power of two consists of only one number and zero numbers bitwise And operator will give me 0 when numbers 1s and 2nd has  at least one zero.

10. I will convert List to Set then convert back Set to List because Set is consist of unique elements.

11. The String expression makes to array of char type then I will each elements of array add in Set is consist of unique elements.  After that I will check equality of Set and string (set.size() == string.length()) if the result is true then string has all unique characters.

12. We can use reverse method by StringBuffer or we should makes to array of char type then create loop, start to from the end to beginning and in every step assign value to  String , example below.
char [] arr = str.toCharArray(); String reverseofStr = '' '';
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length(); i++){
reverseofStr += char[i] 
}

13. String  x = ‘’AAABCCDDDD’’ will make to array of char type and add value of array in Map where key is character and value is integer. If map has value as key it will add 1 to value otherwise will create new key-value pair with 0 value then assign key-value pair to String.

14. I will use Bubble sort algorithm. Array is traversed from first element to last element. Current element is compared with the next element. If current element is greater than the next element, it is swapped.

15. Toaster would have Power block, Timer block, Bread block, Appliance block where I describe size, weight and etc.

16. I will throw at 50 floor. If it breaks so, you know it breaks between floors 50 and 1, otherwise  it breaks between floors 51 and 100. Then I will throw at 25 floor if it breaks so you check between floors 25and 1.I am using binary search algorithm.

17. I will planting them on the angle, each one is touching two walls because each angle is part of two walls.

18. I will divide 9 balls by 3 groups and has 3 ball each of them.
I will compare 1st and 2nd group. If 1st is greater than 2nd then the ball weighs more in 1st group if 2nd is greater than 2nd then the ball weighs more in 2nd group but if weights  are same then the ball weighs more in 3rd group. After then I will compare group of 3 ball and logic above repeated. If 1 ball is greater than 2 so the 1 ball weighs more but if  2 is greater than 1 so 2 ball weighs more and 3 ball weighs more when 1 and 2 weights are same.
